# ReportServer:  Creating a Pivot report

This guide assumes that the ReportServer has a 'datasource' called 'FLOW' containing the Akvo FLOW dataset for Ghana.

Creating a Pivot report in ReportServer begins with configuring a basic Dynamic List report - https://github.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/blob/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/Create_Dynamic_list_report.md

Pivot mode offers further possibilities for ad-hoc analysis of data, new visualizations and charting.

##  Converting Dynamic List report to a Pivot report

Once you have created your Dynamic list report you can switch to a Pivot report by selecting the 'Pivot' option.

![pivot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/150.png?raw=true "pivot")

##  Configuring the Pivot report

We now need to configure the 'Dimensions/Measures'.  This is very similar to setting up the columns to be used in the Dynamic list report, except that you now have a 'Dimension' column with which to group the data.

We need to create at least one 'Measure' before we can use the Pivot.

##  Compiling the Pivot

Once we have configured all required we switch to 'Preview'.

We can now drag and drop our selected 'Dimensions' or columns over to the 'Columns', 'Rows' and 'Filters' area to build the Pivot.  If we want to remove any, we just drag and drop them back to the left.

![pivot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/190.png?raw=true "pivot")

![pivot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/210.png?raw=true "pivot2")

If these are changed at anytime, we need to update the report with the changes by selecting the red 'reload' arrow.

##  Filtering

In the example above we have some 'junk' data.  Data for '#null' under 'Yearconstr' is included. To filter that data we select the magnifying glass on the 'Yearconstr' ROW.  This provides a pop up with filtering options.

![filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/220.png?raw=true "filter")

We select to include only the 'no' and 'yes' data by highlighting them and selecting '>'.  Select 'ok'.

Similarly we can select only the years we want to take into account.

![years](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/250.png?raw=true "years")

![years2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/260.png?raw=true "years2")

Now we can see that our data has been cleaned up!

![clean](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/270.png?raw=true "clean")

##  Visualisation

Here we have made some changes to the Pivot, which gives us a count of the number of pumps in various districts and also tells us whether these pumps are functional or not (no/yes).

![pumps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/328.png?raw=true "pumps")

If we now select the coloured graph to the right, above 'export'we can select to view the report as a variety of different graphs.

![graphs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/350.png?raw=true "graphs")

By selecting 'export' you can export the graph into various different file formats.
