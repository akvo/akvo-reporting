# Executing created reports

This guide describes how to login and execute a previously created report, how to store a change as your own variant of the report and how to utilise TeamSpace.

## Getting started

Begin by logging in to your ReportServer account at https://reporting.akvo.org/reportserver/ReportServer.html.

Select 'ReportManager'.

![ReportManager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003c.png?raw=true "ReportManager")


By opening up the 'Report Root' you will be able to view the folders and reports to which you have access.
