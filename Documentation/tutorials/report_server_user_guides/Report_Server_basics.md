# Report Server basics

This guide describes how to login and execute a previously created report, how to store a change as your own variant of the report and how to utilise TeamSpace.

## Getting started

Begin by logging in to your ReportServer account at https://reporting.akvo.org/reportserver/ReportServer.html.

![login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003a.png?raw=true "login")

Select 'Administration'.  

![administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003b.png?raw=true "administration")


Select 'ReportManager'.

![ReportManager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003c.png?raw=true "ReportManager")


By opening up the 'Report Root' you will be able to view the folders and reports to which you have access.

![reportroot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003d.png?raw=true "reportroot")

For each of your accounts a folder for reports has been created under your name.  A few reports have been added for you to play with.  

If you create new variants they will be created in this folder. Only your reports will be affected by changes you make here.

**The folder 'Ghana_reports' is a shared folder.  What ever changes you make here will be made for everyone.**

![folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003f.png?raw=true "folder")

##  Changing your password

To update your password select the 'welcome, YOURNAME' top right.  A popup will appear, select 'change password'.  Submit when done.  Password changes are immediate.

![password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1090.png?raw=true "password")

## Executing reports

To execute reports from your report folder, right click on the report or variant and select 'execute'.

![executing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003d.png?raw=true "executing")

Select to either configure your report or select the preview to view the saved parameters.

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1050.png?raw=true "preview")

##  Playing with Pivots

If you want to play around with Pivot reports a little, try changing 'filters' and make changes to the 'Dimensions/Measures'. As long as you do not select to 'save' top right, the changes will be lost when you close the report (via the 'x'). 

![dimensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1040.png?raw=true "measures")

![filters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1050.png?raw=true "filters")

![filtering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1051.png?raw=true "filtering")

You can save the changes in a different variant by giving the variant a different name, which means the first variant will remain as it originally was.  See the next section below, 'Saving a variant of a report'.

##  Changing view

View the Pivot as a graph by selecting the 'graph' option top right.

![graphview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1060.png?raw=true "graphview")


Select various types of graphs.  Here a pie chart has been selected as an example.


![executing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1052.png?raw=true "executing")







##  Saving a variant of a report

A variant is a copy of the report where certain parameters have been selected.  These parameters do not need to be selected again but are instead saved as a variant.  If the changes are not saved as variant they need to be reset each time you execute the report.

Select 'Save' top right.

![save](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1079.png?raw=true "save")

Add a name for your variant and select 'Create new variant'

![variant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1080.png?raw=true "variant")

This variant will now appear below the original report in your working folder.

##  Executing a report from TeamSpace

Saving or exporting a report or variant to TeamSpace allows you to share a report or report result with others in the team.

Select 'TeamSpace' to view the ones that have been stored for you as examples.  These are links to the 'Ghana_report' folder.

Double click to execute these reports or select once and then select the 'preview' tab.

![teamspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1010.png?raw=true "teamspace")
