# Report Server basics

This guide describes how to login and execute a previously created report, how to store a change as your own variant of the report and how to utilise TeamSpace.

## Getting started

Begin by logging in to your ReportServer account at https://reporting.akvo.org/reportserver/ReportServer.html.

![login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003a.png?raw=true "login")

Select 'Administration'.  

![administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003b.png?raw=true "administration")


Select 'ReportManager'.

![ReportManager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003c.png?raw=true "ReportManager")


By opening up the 'Report Root' you will be able to view the folders and reports to which you have access.

![reportroot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akvo/akvo-reporting/master/Documentation/tutorials/report_server_user_guides/img/1003d.png?raw=true "reportroot")

For each of your accounts a folder for reports has been created under your name.  A few reports have been added for you to play with.  

If you create new variants they will be created in this folder. Only your reports will be affected by changes you make here.

**The folder 'Ghana_reports' is a shared folder.  What ever changes you make here will be made for everyone.**
