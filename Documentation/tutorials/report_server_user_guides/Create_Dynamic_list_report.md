# ReportServer:  Creating a Dynamic List report

This guide assumes that the ReportServer has a 'datasource' called 'FLOW' containing the Akvo FLOW dataset for Ghana.

##  Configuring the list

Log in to the ReportServer and select 'Reportmanager' in the menu to the left.  Select 'Report Root' and either create a new folder in which to add your report, or select an exisiting folder.  Right click on the folder & select 'insert' and then 'Dynamic list'.
